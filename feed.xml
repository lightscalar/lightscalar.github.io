        <title>How Much Water Can You Pour Into a Tesseract?</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-red-box&quot;&gt;The Red Box.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;cubes&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;cubes&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/artists_conception.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An artist’s conception of the two boxes now on your kitchen table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Two empty boxes&lt;/span&gt;  now sit on your kitchen table. The one on
the left is red, the one on the right is blue, but near as you can tell they’re
otherwise identical. For the moment let’s focus on the red box. It is a cube,
so its edges are identical, and each edge happens to be one meter in length, or
about three feet. Now a simple question: How much water could you pour into
this red cube?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, a cubic meter of water,” you reply, which is the volume of the cube. And
you’re not wrong, of course, but what does that look like? In more everyday
units, a cubic meter corresponds to 1,000 liters. That’s &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;500&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
two-liter bottles of soda, or if this makes more visceral sense to you, about
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}330&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bottles of wine. That seems a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because water is so dense, about &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kg/m³, this means the
topped-off red box weighs a metric ton, or &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2{,}200&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lbs. A metric
ton! This seems wrong. An 8 oz glass of water weighs hardly anything at all,
yet a three foot cube filled with water, which cube fits comfortably on your
kitchen table, weighs a ton? It’s true, but why is it surprising?  The shock
stems from our faulty intuition about how volume scales with size. That 8 oz
glass of water seems smaller than the box, sure, but not that much smaller, not
so much smaller that it weighs half a pound to the box’s metric ton. But in
fact the volume is quite a bit smaller. While the red cube boasts a volume of
1.0 m³, that eight ounce glass of water is an ignominious &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.0002&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; m³,
or &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;5{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; times smaller, volume-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we make the red cube larger, things get predictably worse. Doubling its edge
does not double its volume, but rather increases it by a factor of
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2^3=8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A two-meter cube filled with water would weigh eight metric
tons, or more than &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;17{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lbs, and would require
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; two liter bottles to fill it. This is now starting to be a
structural issue for your kitchen table, your kitchen, and possibly your
marriage&lt;label for=&quot;marriage&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;marriage&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Hence we will perform this experiment only in our minds. &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That three in &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; comes about because the red cube resides in three
spatial dimensions. The volume of a cube with edge length &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;L&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is given
by,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;V=L^3\tag{1}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we increase the size of the cube by a factor of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, its volume
increases by a factor of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That power of
three is the explanation for the alarmingly vast difference between the weight
of that glass of water and the weight of that red box, and is fundamentally
tied to the number of dimensions of the spacetime in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blue-box&quot;&gt;The Blue Box.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;But now to the empty box&lt;/span&gt;  on the right, the blue one. In all
obvious respects it is a one-meter cube like its red compatriot. Except it’s
not. This is no blue cube at all, but rather a blue hypercube. Or a tesseract.
Or a four-dimensional box. We will use these terms interchangeably, and we will
not worry how I came to possess the thing, what strings I pulled, what favors I
called in, or how I got it into your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited as you are to three spatial dimensions, you might well walk past the
blue box without realizing it is special. After all you cannot detect, in three
dimensions, how this box pokes into the fourth. But it does nevertheless.  Its
volume is not &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; m³, but rather &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; m⁴. In general, a
hypercube with edge length &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;L&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has a volume is given by,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;V = L^4 \tag{2}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as before, we ask the question: how much water can we pour into this thing?
How many of those two liter soda bottles, or those &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;750&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ml wine
bottles will it take to fill this blue hyperbox? If you turn on your kitchen
faucet and start filling bottles, how much municipal water will you store in
that one-meter tesseract? What would such a thing weigh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of question that strains the imagination and keeps a certain
type of person from a good night’s sleep. We rightly wonder, Does the Question
Even Make Sense? Water being a three-dimensional fluid lives in the space
defined by the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;z&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axes. The tesseract
on the other hand is a four-dimensional beast, residing in the hyperspace
defined by the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;z&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and, let’s say,
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axes. How do we make sense of this? Let’s attack the problem
step-by-step. First, what exactly do we mean by tesseract?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-tesseract&quot;&gt;What Is a Tesseract?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;A tesseract&lt;/span&gt;  is the four-dimensional analogue of the
three-dimensional cube. It is to a cube what a cube is to a square, what a
square is to a line segment, or what a line segment is to a point. The figure
below may or may not help you make sense of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;From a point to a tesseract. A one-dimensional cube is two “parallel” points connected by a line segment. A square is formed by connecting two parallel line segments, a cube by connecting two parallel squares. A tesseract, then, is simply two parallel cubes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/building_a_tesseract.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin, simply enough, on the far left, with a single point,
an object of zero dimension. We can think of it as a zero-dimensional cube. To
create its higher-dimensional counterpart, we drag the point along the blue
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axis, creating a line segment, which we can think of as a
1-dimensional cube. In an analogous fashion, we drag the line segment along a
perpendicular dimension, the green &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axis, to trace a square (a 2-D
cube) in the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plane.  If we drag that square along the
red &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;z&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axis, we trace a cube (that is, our familiar, everyday 3-D
cube) in the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;z&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; space. The cube in the
third panel is not really a cube, of course, since the screen is only
two-dimensional, but rather a projection or shadow of a cube. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now the hard part, the impossible&lt;label for=&quot;iphone&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;iphone&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;If you have an iPhone, I recommend the excellent app called The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourthdimensionapp.com&quot;&gt;Fourth Dimension&lt;/a&gt;, which builds intuition on these matters by allowing you to interact with, rotate, and otherwise muck around with hypercubes. &lt;/span&gt; leap: to create a hypercube, we must drag
our cube along a dimension perpendicular to each of the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;y&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;z&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axes. We’ll call this the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-axis.
Human imagination, or at least mine, is limited, which makes the matter of
visualizing a 4-D cube a bit maddening. The far-right panel above nevertheless
illustrates the hypercube — the object we obtain by dragging the cube along the
yellow w-axis. We’re not really seeing four dimensions here of course. Just as
with the cube, we are merely seeing its two-dimensional shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;hypercube&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;hypercube&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/tesseract.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An animated projection of a rotating hypercube. It makes sense if you think about it long enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the animation to the right. It shows a projection of a hypercube as it
rotates through the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-dimension. Though unintuitive at first, you
may be surprised at the insight you can gain by trying to understand why it is
doing that. On the other hand, if you fail, you will be delighted to know that we
need not be able to visualize four-dimensional objects in order to reason
about them, as we’ll see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the hypercubes. What about the water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;water-simplified&quot;&gt;Water, Simplified.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Water is a molecule&lt;/span&gt;  comprising two hydrogen atoms and an
oxygen atom, but we’ll not be too concerned with its chemistry beyond a few
salient properties. In fact, we won’t worry about the structure of the water
molecule at all but, like proper physicists, treat the water molecules as
spheres. From here on out, we’ll think of the water molecules as hard spherical
masses with a fixed radius, R, as illustrated in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, but like proper physicists, we’ll assume each water molecule is just a hard sphere with a fixed radius.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/chemistry_is_hard.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three dimensions, the position of every water molecule is specified by three
coordinates. Molecule &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;i&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, for example, can be found at position
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\mathbf{r}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Another molecule, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;j&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, will
collide with the first if the following is true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2 \le (2R)^2\tag{2}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the two molecules will collide if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance&quot;&gt;Euclidean
Distance&lt;/a&gt; between their
centers is less than twice their common radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two spherical water molecules will collide if their centers are separated by twice their common radius, independent of how many dimensions they inhabit.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/water_collision.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about water in this way is useful because we can readily segue to four
dimensions. In that case — inside the tesseract, for example — we must specify
four coordinates, not three; &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\mathbf{r}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i, w_i)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
And now collision between two molecules occurs if,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2 + (w_i-w_j)^2 \le
(2R)^2\tag{3}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference here being we calculate the distance between molecules using the
four-dimensional Euclidean metric, rather than the three-dimensional one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now an important side note: aside from this extra coordinate and its geometric
implications, we assume that the introduction of a fourth dimension does
nothing to substantially alter physics. In fact, adding an extra spatial
dimension will certainly muck up our chemistry, perturbing quantum mechanics,
changing the nature of water, altering its rotational and vibrational modes,
absorption spectra, effective radius, and so forth. We could explore extensions
to standard physics such
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza–Klein_theory&quot;&gt;Kaluza-Klein&lt;/a&gt; theory,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory&quot;&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory&quot;&gt;M-theory&lt;/a&gt;, which posit or demand the
existence of additional spatial dimensions, and which might provide insight
into how the underlying physics is thereby perturbed. But we shall not be
heading down those rabbit holes here. We will focus exclusively on on the
geometry of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;mole&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mole&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Recall that a mole is a unit of measurement corresponding to the number of representative particles in a chemical substance equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon-12. That number is known as Avogadro’s constant, which has a value of just over 602 sextillion mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; you can regard it as a conversion factor of sorts between the atomic and macroscopic worlds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, here is all the chemistry we’ll need. The effective radius of a
water molecule is about &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.135&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nm. It has a mass of 0.018 kg/mole,
which means that a collection of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;6.02\times10^{23}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; water molecules
weighs 0.018 kg. Under everyday conditions, as we’ve already noted, liquid
water has a density of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kg/m³.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three dimensions, we find that the volume of a single water molecule — what
is typically known as its &lt;em&gt;specific volume&lt;/em&gt; — is very tiny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;V_{\text{3D water}_{}}=\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.135
\times 10^{-9} \text{m})^3 = 7.7\times 10^{-30} \text{m}^3 \tag{4}
\label{specific}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where we’ve used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere&quot;&gt;usual equation&lt;/a&gt; for
the volume of a sphere in three dimensions. The red box, that ordinary
three-dimensional cube, when filled with water, weighs &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kg.
This means it contains &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kg/(&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.018&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kg/mole)
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\approx 55{,}555&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; moles of water, or around
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;3.3\times10^{28}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; individual water molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total volume occupied by all these molecules (given the specific volume of
a water molecule à la Eq. &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\ref{specific}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;V_{\text{water}_{}}=3.3\times10^{28} \text{molecules} \times
7.7\times10^{-30}\text{m}^3/\text{molecule}\approx 0.3 \text{ m}^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we find a surprise. We have filled a &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\text{m}^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; box with water but find the total volume occupied by the
water molecules amounts only to 30% of the total volume! Water, it seems, is
70% empty space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why all that space? The reason is that water molecules are not densely
packed like oranges at a grocery store. They’re not constantly in contact with
one other, but are free to jiggle and collide — and this leaves a lot of empty
room between. Chemists define the &lt;em&gt;packing fraction&lt;/em&gt; of a substance, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0
\lt \eta \le 1 &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, as the total volume of space that is occupied by the
constituent particles. The packing fraction of water is therefore &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\eta
\approx 0.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Gaseous water vapor, on the other hand, which is far less
dense than liquid water, has a packing fraction on the order of
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10^{-8}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;bicker&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;bicker&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;One may find slightly different values for the effective radius of water kicking around in the literature. Do not let this ruin your day; a slightly different effective radius implies a slightly different packing fraction in order to obtain the observed density. More important is the order of magnitude of the quantities involved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may write down a relation for the total number of molecules that can be
stored in a box of given volume in terms of the specific volume of the
constituent molecules and the fluid’s packing fraction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N_{\text{molecules}_{}}= \frac{\eta
V_{\text{box}}}{V_{\text{molecule}}} \tag{5} \label{formula}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in words: to determine the total number of particles in a box,
we simply divide the total effective volume we are filling, which is &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\eta
V_{\text{box}_{}} &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, by the volume occupied by a single molecule,
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;V_{\text{molecule}_{}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Importantly, this relation holds for any
number of dimensions, so long as we compute volumes (or lengths, or areas, or
hypervolumes) consistently for both box and molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-digression-packing-fractions&quot;&gt;A Brief Digression: Packing Fractions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a quick moment to talk more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing&quot;&gt;sphere
packing&lt;/a&gt;, the object of which is
to find the arrangement of spheres that occupies the largest possible
proportion of a space, or to describe how spheres, when left to their own
devices and subject to various constraints, manage to arrange themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration below shows two different packings of 2-D spheres in the
plane, so: &lt;em&gt;circle packing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two different circle packings. On the left, square packing leads to a packing ratio of 79%. On the right, the provably optimal hexagonal packing leads to a ratio of 91%.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/circle_packing.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement on the left, known as a square packing because the circle
centers are arranged in a square, has circles occupying 79% of the plane.  The
packing on the right, known as a hexagonal packing, which is provably optimal,
has circles occupying 91% of the plane. In one dimension, the best packing
ratio for spheres (which on a line is just line segment packing) is 1.  In
three dimensions, the best packing fraction drops to 0.74. In dimensions higher
than three the sphere packing problem remains unsolved—except, thanks to the
exploitation of certain symmetries, in dimensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160330-sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions/&quot;&gt;eight and
twenty-four&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this discursiveness is that spheres pack differently in different
dimensions, even if they’re not being optimally packed, and if we’re going to
pour water molecules into the fourth dimension, we should worry at least a
little bit about how they might decide to arrange themselves once there. As a
general rule, as we increase the dimension of the space, the packing fraction
of spheres decreases precipitously, at least according to computer simulations.
In one investigation, the average random packing ratio scales with the
dimension, &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;d&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://cherrypit.princeton.edu/papers/paper-249.pdf&quot;&gt;empirically
determined&lt;/a&gt; formula,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\eta_d = -2.72/2^d + (2.56 d)/2^d \tag{6} \label{pfrac} &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;d=3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we find that the packing ratio is &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.62&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;d=4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it becomes &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.47&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a 25% decrease. But a caveat: these
results were derived for a specific packing scenario known as &lt;em&gt;disordered
jammed spheres&lt;/em&gt;, which is not exactly the scenario at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water molecules are not in constant contact, but their mean free path (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;,
the average distance a molecule can travel between collisions) is less than the
average intermolecular separation. It would be an interesting exercise to
simulate how spheres pack in this scenario, and I leave this as an exercise to
the motivated reader, but at this point we take the possibly dubious and
certainly hand-wavy step of assuming that the packing fraction of water in four
dimensions will be discounted according to the above formula. That is, if the
packing fraction of water in three dimensions is 0.3, then in four dimensions
it will be about 0.25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be quite right, but as we’ll see, for all this garment rending,
the precise packing fraction will not make too much of a difference. In four or
five dimensions, at least, it is on the order of unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-do-it-pouring-water-into-the-tesseract&quot;&gt;Let’s Do It: Pouring Water Into the Tesseract.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;When we pour our first liter&lt;/span&gt;  of water into the blue box, what
happens? The water molecules, entering the box, find themselves liberated from
the confines of three-dimensional space; they acquire a new coordinate,
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w_i&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and can suddenly move in the &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-direction. Their
specific volume, too, changes. They are still spheres defined by a radius of
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;R=0.135&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nm, but in four dimensions, volume is no longer given by Eq.
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\ref{specific}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It must be computed as the volume of a
four-dimensional &lt;em&gt;hypersphere&lt;/em&gt;. That volume is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ball&quot;&gt;given
by&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt; V_{\text{4D water}_{}} = \frac{ \pi^2 }{2} R^4 = \frac{\pi^2}{2}
(0.135 \text{ nm})^4 = 1.64\times10^{-39} \text{m}^4 \label{4D} \tag{7}
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll call this water’s &lt;em&gt;specific hypervolume&lt;/em&gt;. Note that it is many orders of
magnitude smaller than its three-dimensional analogue (though understand we’re
not comparing apples to apples here, but &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\text{m}^4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\text{m}^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are finally in a position to calculate the total number of water molecules
we can fit into your tesseract. Using Eqs. &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\ref{formula}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\ref{4D}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and with &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\eta=0.25&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we find,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mathblock&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N_{\text{molecules}_{}} = 0.25 \frac{1.0 \text{ m}^4}{1.64 \times
10^{-39} \text{m}^4} = 1.5 \times 10^{38}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;lake_zurich&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lake_zurich&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/lake_zurich.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of Lake Zurich could be poured into that four-dimensional hypercube on your kitchen table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is something like &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10^{14}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; moles of water, which would weigh
about &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;4.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; billion metric tons, and, in three dimensions, occupy a
cubic mile. For comparison, that is roughly the size of Lake Zurich, in
Switzerland. A cubic mile of water! Sitting on your kitchen table! Recall that
it took 500 two liter soda bottles to fill our red 3-D cube; it would take over
two billion such bottles to fill our blue tesseract. It seems there is a lot of
extra space in four dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to calculate these things, we can run wild. Suppose that
instead of the one meter hypercube, we had a more reasonably sized, one inch,
pocket-sized hypercube? How much water can we fit in one of those? Running the
same calculations above with a hypervolume of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1 \text{ inch}^4 = 4.16
\times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^4 &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yields an effective volume of &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2{,}000
\text{ m}^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This is nearly the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
And you could carry it around in your pocket, except that it would weigh
&lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;2{,}000&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt; metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite expectedly, hypervolumes grow even faster than 3-D volumes as length
scale increases. If we had a four-dimensional Olympic swimming pool&lt;label for=&quot;pool&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;pool&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;That is, an ordinary three-dimensional Olympic swimming pool that happens to extend into the fourth dimension a distance equal to the (3-D) length of the pool. &lt;/span&gt;, for example, we could accommodate the entire Black Sea. Such is the power of powers
of four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since we’re bending the rules of our Universe anyway, why not consider even
higher dimensional containers—a five-dimensional box, perhaps? We should expect
even more dramatic storage capacities. If I were to loan you my green,
five-dimensional hypercube, how much water could you fit in that? I’ll leave it
to the reader to calculate the details, but it would exceed &lt;span&gt;​&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10^{19}
\text{ m}^3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, enough to accommodate all the water on Earth, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;oceans&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;oceans&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/oceans_for_scale.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A five-dimensional hypercube with one meter edges could easily contain all the water in all the oceans on Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your now very distressed kitchen table.&lt;/p&gt;
